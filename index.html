        <p class="description">
          A blockchain is a chronological record of digitized events. Copies of
          the network are stored among multiple parties, giving blockchain
          technology its unique advantage over traditional databases: it cannot
          be altered. With an unalterable and permanent time-stamped audit trail
          of data, blockchain technology provides greater transparency, enhanced
          security, improved traceability, increased efficiency, and reduced
          costs.
